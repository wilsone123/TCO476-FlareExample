                <p>San Diego is just a few miles from the Mexican border, and the cultural influence is apparent in its authentic Mexican cuisine. You can't go far without seeing a locally owned taco shop selling street tacos. Be sure to try some carne asada fries or a California burrito; these San Diego specialties feature tasty meat and french fries (yes, even the burrito!) and can't be found in other parts of the United States.</p>

                <p>If you're still hungry, be on the lookout for a food truck! You're sure to find one at one of San Diego's many outdoor festivals or events, or even parked at a local brewery or mall. Food trucks offer dining on-the-go and serve up tasty gourmet meals. There is a food truck for every appetite: bratwursts, salads, crabcakes, hot dogs, crepes, pierogi, and more.</p>
